	  A lightweight certificate generation utility using mbedTLS.

	  This tool generates self-signed SSL certificates for embedded
	  devices using the mbedTLS library. It provides a minimal
	  alternative to the full mbedTLS programs suite, saving
	  significant space (~500KB+) while providing only the
	  certificate generation functionality needed.

	  Features:
	  - RSA and ECDSA key generation
	  - Self-signed certificate creation
	  - Configurable validity periods
	  - Minimal memory footprint
