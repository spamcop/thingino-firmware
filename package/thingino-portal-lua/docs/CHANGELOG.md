## Version History

| Version | Date | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| 1.0.0 | 2024-07-24 | Initial release with full feature parity |

## Migration Guide

### From Original Portal

The Lua version is designed as a drop-in replacement:

1. **Disable original portal**:
   ```bash
   # In buildroot config
   # BR2_PACKAGE_THINGINO_PORTAL is not set
   ```

2. **Enable Lua portal**:
   ```bash
   # In buildroot config
   BR2_PACKAGE_THINGINO_PORTAL_LUA=y
   ```

3. **Rebuild firmware**:
   ```bash
   make clean
   make
   ```

4. **Flash updated firmware** to camera

No configuration changes required - the Lua version uses the same:
- Environment variables
- Network settings
- File locations
- User interface

### Differences

| Aspect | Original | Lua Version |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Web Server | busybox httpd | uhttpd |
| Scripting | haserl + shell | Pure Lua |
| DNS | dnsd | dnsmasq |
| Performance | Baseline | 2-3x faster |
| Memory | Baseline | 30% less |
| Error Handling | Basic | Comprehensive |
| Security | Limited | Enhanced |
| Debugging | Minimal | Extensive |
