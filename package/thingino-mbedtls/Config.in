	  Thingino enhanced mbed TLS with WebRTC DTLS compatibility.
	  Based on mbed TLS (formerly known as PolarSSL) with additional
	  cipher suites and configurations optimized for embedded WebRTC
	  applications.

	  This shadow package provides enhanced DTLS support for WebRTC
	  while maintaining the lightweight footprint needed for embedded
	  systems.

	  This option enables the installation and the build of
	  mbed TLS companion programs.

config BR2_PACKAGE_THINGINO_MBEDTLS_COMPRESSION
	bool "enable compression support"
	select BR2_PACKAGE_ZLIB
	help
	  Enable support for compression of the content data before it
	  enters the secure channel as described in RFC 3749.

	  Warning: TLS compression may make you vulnerable to the
	  CRIME attack. You should not enable it unless you know for
	  sure CRIME and similar attacks are not applicable to your
	  particular situation.

config BR2_PACKAGE_THINGINO_MBEDTLS_DTLS_SRTP
	bool "enable DTLS-SRTP support"
	default y
	help
	  Enable support for negotiation of DTLS-SRTP (RFC 5764)
	  through the use_srtp extension.

	bool "enable WebRTC DTLS compatibility"
	default y
	select BR2_PACKAGE_THINGINO_MBEDTLS_DTLS_SRTP
	help
	  Enable enhanced cipher suite support for WebRTC DTLS compatibility.
	  This includes RSA key exchange, additional hash algorithms, and
	  broader cipher suite support for better browser compatibility.
	  Note: This increases binary size but improves WebRTC interoperability.
