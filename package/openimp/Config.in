	  OpenIMP is an open-source implementation of the Ingenic IMP
	  (Image Media Process) library. It provides a reverse-engineered
	  implementation of libimp.so that can replace the proprietary
	  Ingenic library.

	  This package builds after ingenic-sdk and ingenic-lib and
	  overrides the usr/lib/libimp.so library with the open-source
	  implementation.
