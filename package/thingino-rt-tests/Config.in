  Real-time testing suite for embedded Linux systems.
  
  This package provides a comprehensive set of programs to test
  various real-time features of the Linux kernel, including:
  
  - cyclictest: High resolution timer latency test
  - pi_stress: Priority inheritance mutex stress test
  - signaltest: Signal handling latency test
  - rt-migrate-test: Real-time task migration test
  - ptsematest: POSIX semaphore test
  - sigwaittest: Signal wait test
  - svsematest: SysV semaphore test
  - pmqtest: POSIX message queue test
  - sendme: Signal round-trip test
  - pip_stress: Priority inheritance pipe stress test
  - hackbench: Scheduler benchmark

  Optimized for embedded targets with cross-compilation support
  and musl libc compatibility. Python components (hwlatdetect) and
  documentation are excluded to minimize footprint.
